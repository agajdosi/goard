# Example shows checks of OpenShift templates used in addons of Minishift.
# To run the example, run command:

# Files structure can be used to compare two individualy defined files.
# Any of the two can be local file or file accessible via URL address.
files:
  # compares two local files
- this: examples/my-repo/template1
  that: examples/origin-repo/template1
  # compares local file with remote file
- this: examples/my-repo/template2
  that: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agajdosi/goard/master/examples/origin-repo/template2
  # compares remote file with local file
- this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agajdosi/goard/master/examples/origin-repo/template3

# Directories structure can be used to compare all files from directory with local or remote directory location.
# First location has to be local as Goard will get list of all files in the directory automatically (cannot be done
# via URL) and will then compare those with files at remote location.
directories:
  # checks whether all files in LOCAL DIRECTORY are the same as identically named files in another local directory.
- dir:
  - examples/my-repo
  - examples/origin-repo
  # checks whether defined files in directory are the same as the identically named files in another directory
- dir:
  - examples/origin-repo
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agajdosi/goard/master/examples/origin-repo
  files:
  - template1
  - template2
